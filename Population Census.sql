--I am happy to announce that I am working on a new problem

--"population census"

--I need to make a GitHub for it

--I need to improve how I create repositories.
--I think I always get the same error message and I never know how to fix.

--"Unable to create the new repository because there are too many new files in this directory."

--I think I looked into it previously and just got nothing to learn from.

--but when I look back I can see that it was made in the local folder.
--it is also listed in the list of repositories but under "Other"
--then I am asked wheather it can be trusted.
--I say yes
--and the repository is perfectly added.
