--I am happy to announce that I am working on a new problem

--"population census"

--I need to make a GitHub for it

--I need to improve how I create repositories.
--I think I always get the same error message and I never know how to fix.

--"Unable to create the new repository because there are too many new files in this directory."

--I think I looked into it previously and just got nothing to learn from.

--but when I look back I can see that it was made in the local folder.
--it is also listed in the list of repositories but under "Other"
--then I am asked wheather it can be trusted.
--I say yes
--and the repository is perfectly added.

--everything is set!

--great!

--Let me go ahead and start reading the problem

--actually, I need to upload the tables.

--there are two.

--the CITY and COUNTRY tables.

--I will use my usual SELECT * table_name
--and copy paste that into a notepadd ++ file
--but I used to use another program.
--notepad?
--yeah

--it is very long.
--the table CITY has lots of rows that I am definitely going to take a while breaking in.

--------------------------------------07 14 2025----------------------------------------

--ok,

--I am going to keep wiorking on the table CITY.


--I just finished placing commas on the CITY.txt file which I will now upload into a table using the import wizard

--can't help but feel like I should automate this somehow?

--that's right
--I forgot I have to make a new database.
--I will name it Population Census.

--database created.

--next, I need to create the tables.

--the first table I will create is CITY.

--I am excited to get that done.  Probably next time.

---------------------------------07 15 2025---------------------------------------

--ok,

--tonight I am planning on creating the CITY table.

--and maybe get started on the other table.

--tried to use the import export wizard but kept getting errors
--do I have any records of how to do this?

--I am going to have to make sure I get screen shots this time.

----------------------------------07 20 2025-------------------------------------

--ok,

--back at it

--let me see I should be able to figure this out like I did last time many times.

--I think I finally figured it out
--it was really long and tedious
--but I had to make sure there were not spaces, just commas.
--so, not like how I am structuring this sentence.
--but like this,if there is a comma,just no space after it.

--let me call up the table

USE Population_Census;
SELECT *
	FROM CITY;

--Ok,
--perfect.

--how can I call this up again next time I need help?
--I need to make a notation
--yeah,
--I am at a loss as to how to create a resource to remember how to upload tables.
--I may have to make a video for the next time.
--and upload that video to my github.

--------------------------------------07 21 2025------------------------------
--Alright,
--got started on the COUNTRY table
--it is very complicated.
--this will take a lot of time.
--dare I say one week?
--just on the one table?
--hopefully not.


---------------------------------08 07 2025-----------------------------------------------
USE Population_Census;
SELECT *
	FROM COUNTRY;

--Hving a hard time uploading the COUNTRY table

--I had the same problem last time with the CITY table but I got it going
--I forgot how I did it.

--next time I will study the microsoft webpage on the topic

------------------------------08 24 2025-----------------------------

--i thought I had coppied the error but I didn't

--i am stuck trying to do what I consider to be an easy thing
--importing a table
--it seems like I have to choose some other source that isn't the same as the destination
--next time I may just choose another source altogether to make it work?

--but I don't think i have ever had to do it this way?

--but an article I ran into says that weird things happen all the time
--and just to try a bunch of things until it works.
